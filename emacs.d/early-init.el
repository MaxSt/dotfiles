;; Emacs HEAD (27+) introduces early-init.el, which is run before init.el,
;; before package and UI initialization happens.

;; Defer garbage collection further back in the startup process
(setq gc-cons-threshold 268435456)

;; Disable package.el at startup, since use-package will handle the package loading
(setq package-enable-at-startup nil)

;; Prevent the glimpse of un-styled Emacs by setting these early.
